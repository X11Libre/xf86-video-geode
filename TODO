This is the list of things that need to be done

=== LX driver ===

CORE:
* Compression is pretty much hosed
* Artifacts are on the screen - they are probably render related
* Screen panning

EXA:
* Support a8 as a source or destination (?)
* Convert masks with an alpha chanel to a8 and a4 masks (?)
* Support multiple pass operations when a mask is enabled
* See if we can figure out a way to set the correct alpha when the source
  format doesn't have an alpha channel but the destination does
* Handle masks when the source isn't 1x1
* Rendercheck still has many failures
* We assume that the destination buffer fits in the scratch buffer during
  a multipass operation

VIDEO:
* Support rotated video (rotate the YUV source)
