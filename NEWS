Geode 2.11.13 (2011-12-26)
==========================
This release mainly features a complete overhaul of the building scripts plus
a cleanup of deprecated macros. The key benefit is that this Geode driver can
finally build on FreeBSD and on other platforms not offering V4L2 support and
that it can also build on a 64-bit host using its 32-bit personality.

Support for the Video Input Port (VIP) feature of the Geode LX found in 'ztv'
is now documented and the source code saw the removal of deprecated Linux 2.4
backward compatibility code. Compiling is skipped on platforms without V4L2.

Configuration for laptops featuring WXGA resolutions is finally documented.

Setting the GEODE_TRACE_FALL macro now enables composite operation tracing on
this driver. This can be used to profile the performance during development.

Fixes to keep this driver compilable on recent X servers are also included.

VALIDATION PLATFORMS
* Debian/stable (X server 1.7.7) on Artec DBE61 and Hercules EC-800.
* Ubuntu/Precise (X server 1.10.4) on FIC ION603A.

Geode 2.11.12 (2011-02-13)
==========================
This release drops the "linux/videodev.h" include in z4l.c because
V4L1 support was dropped as of Linux kernel 2.6.38, and it fixes 
packed overlay offscreen allocations.

Geode 2.11.11 (2010-12-27)
==========================
This release restores code compatibility down to X server 1.4, it fixes
compilation under 1.9.99 and newer, and it improves handling of gamma
correction in video vs graphics

Geode 2.11.10 (2010-11-09)
==========================
This release migrates deprecated xalloc/xrealloc/xfree/xcalloc calls
to malloc/realloc/free/calloc, fixes several DCON-specific issues, 
improves mode validation and adds support for one WXGA resolution.

Geode 2.11.9 (2010-08-23)
=========================
We are pleased to announce this maintenance release of xf86-video-geode.
It features a plethora of bug fixes, a few documentation updates and one
performance enhancement.

This release also marks the return of AMD to the development team. 

Noticeable changes compared to 2.11.8
-------------------------------------
 * Fixes all known rendering bugs, most notably those pertaining to the
   GNOME and KDE desktop environments, to video player applications and
   to the Chrome and Firefox browsers.

 * Dramatically improves the performance:
                      Before         After
    -aa10text         4660/sec       53300/sec
    -aa24text         2740/sec       16200/sec

 * Validates resolutions rather than resorts to virtual screen sizes.
   Adds a new screen resolution at 106.50MHz to those we know about.

 * Clarifies the copyrights of each file and updates COPYING to match.
